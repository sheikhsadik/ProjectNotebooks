I conduct a wholistic survey of all popular trend following indicators documented in literature. I use a total of 96 futures contracts across different asset classes (Equities, Fixed Income, Commodities, FX etc.), with the longest available contracts dating back to 1975.
The general motivation of the project is established in two parts:
1) To assess whether an ensemble approach will improve the overall predictability of a trend following system, as opposed the famous 12 month momentum metric. 
2) To investigate the efficacy of risk based portfolio construction methods and aggregation across different portfolio construction models will improve risk adjusted returns.
