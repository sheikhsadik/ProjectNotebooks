This repository contains all my personal projects worked on so far. Most of my projects cover systematic strategies and portfolio construction, mostly in the equities and futures space.
There are a few paper replication notebooks of some famous empirical asset pricing literatures. I also post projects related to specific trading strategies 
(Pairs Trading, Momentum etc.) and my experimentation of machine learning in augmenting systematic strategies.
